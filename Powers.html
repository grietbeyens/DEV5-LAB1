        I love working out and coaching other people to achieve their goals! I
        like to expand my cultural knowledge by traveling a lot around the
        globe. In terms, my passion for exploring showed me that I value getting
        out of my shell a lot. I truly believe that it will help me grow as a
        person in general.

        I love teaching kids tennis lessons. I also love to play tennis myself.
        I've been a tennis teacher for a good 4 years now. I also love to travel
        and explore new places. I've been to a lot of countries and I hope to
        visit many more in the future. Expanding my knowledge is something I
        always strive towards, although sometimes it's difficult to concentrate
        and follow along with my ADHD.
