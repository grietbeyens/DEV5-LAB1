    <h2>How do we feel about Dev5? ðŸ‘€</h2>
    <p>Overall we feel excited, but also a little bit scared ngl. 
    The briefing was a bit scary because there were a lot of things we will go over. 
    We love achieving good results, but learning something new is something we enjoy even more.</p>
    <strong>Excited to see what's coming next! âš¡âš¡âš¡</strong>
